# Blinto LLC Task Project

## Personal Overview

Working on the **Blinto LLC Task Project** was a very enriching experience for me.  
Using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**, I built a responsive, user-friendly website.  
Throughout the development process, I focused on writing clean, organized code and maintaining a mobile-first design approach.  
Overall, this project helped me sharpen my frontend development skills, especially in **responsive design**.  
I believe this project reflects my growth as a **junior frontend developer** and my dedication to learning and improving through practical challenges.

## Challenges Faced During the Blinto LLC Task Project

While developing the project, I encountered and overcame several challenges:

### 1. Making the Navbar Responsive
- Designing a fully responsive navigation bar was challenging.
- I had to ensure that the navbar adapted perfectly across different screen sizes while maintaining a clean and smooth user experience, especially on mobile devices.

### 2. Responsive Design for the App Download Section
- Adjusting the app download section layout for various devices was tricky.
- I needed to carefully manage spacing, alignment, and element scaling to make the section look professional on both large screens and smartphones.

### 3. Building a Mobile Menu with JavaScript
- Implementing a dynamic menu for mobile devices using vanilla JavaScript was a valuable learning curve.
- I created functionality where clicking a menu icon would smoothly open and close the mobile navigation without using any external libraries.

### 4. Interactive Review Section for Mobile Devices
- In the review section, I added a button for mobile screens.
- When clicked, it displays all user reviews. Making this functionality work correctly and seamlessly on mobile devices was quite challenging for me.

Each of these challenges pushed me to strengthen my **problem-solving skills** and deepen my understanding of **responsive design** and **vanilla JavaScript interactivity**.
